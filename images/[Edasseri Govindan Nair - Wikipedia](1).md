Edasseri's most popular and celebrated work is Poothappattu, which he wrote in 1946. It is a long narrative poem that tells the story of a flower seller who falls in love with a princess and faces many hardships and tragedies. The poem is rich in symbolism, imagery, and emotion, and explores the themes of love, fate, social injustice, and human dignity. The poem has been adapted into various forms of art, such as drama, film, dance, and music.
 
Another notable work of Edasseri is Kavile Pattu, which he wrote in 1966. It is a collection of poems that depict the life and culture of the tribal people living in the forests of Wayanad. Edasseri was inspired by his visit to the tribal settlements and his interaction with them. He portrayed them with respect and admiration, and highlighted their harmony with nature, their wisdom, their customs, and their struggles. The poems also express his concern for the preservation of the tribal identity and heritage in the face of modernization and exploitation.
 
Edasseri was also a pioneer of modern Malayalam drama, who experimented with various forms and styles. He wrote historical plays based on the legends of Kerala, such as Noolimala, which narrates the story of the martyrdom of Kunjali Marakkar, the naval chief of the Zamorin. He also wrote social plays that dealt with contemporary issues, such as Kootukrishi, which exposes the corruption and hypocrisy of the cooperative movement. He also wrote comedies that satirized the follies and foibles of human nature, such as Kaliyum Chiriyum, which mocks the superstitions and rituals of astrology.
