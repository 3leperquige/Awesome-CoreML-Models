## Hosting a multiplayer game
 
If you want to host a multiplayer game, you need to share your IP address with other players. You can find your IP address by typing "what is my IP" in Google or using a website like [https://www.whatismyip.com/](https://www.whatismyip.com/). Then, in the start screen of the game, choose "LAN" or "Internet" depending on your connection type. This will take you to a lobby where you can wait for other players to join your game. You can also customize the game settings, such as difficulty, map, and rules[^1^].
 
## Joining a multiplayer game
 
If you want to join a multiplayer game, you need to know the IP address of the host. You can enter it in the start screen of the game by choosing "Internet" and then "Direct Connect". Alternatively, you can scan for LAN games or Internet games by clicking on the respective buttons. This will show you a list of available servers that you can join[^1^]. You can also filter the servers by name, version, password, and players.
 
## Hotjoining and takeover
 
One of the features of Europa Universalis 4 multiplayer is that you can join or leave a game in progress. This is called hotjoining and takeover. Hotjoining means that you can enter a game that is already running and pick any country that is not controlled by another player or the AI. You will inherit whatever situation the country is in at that point. The host can accept or reject your hotjoin request[^1^]. Takeover means that you can leave a game and let the AI take over your country until you return. The AI will be passive for a full year to allow you to catch up[^1^].
 
## Finding multiplayer games
 
If you don't have any friends to play with, you can still find multiplayer games online. There are several ways to do that. One is to use the Community tab in the multiplayer interface, which allows you to promote and find multiplayer games over the Internet[^1^]. Another is to use the Multiplayer Forum on the Paradox website, where you can post or browse for games and communicate with other players[^1^]. A third option is to watch YouTube videos or Twitch streams of people playing Europa Universalis 4 multiplayer and join their games if they allow it[^2^].
 
## Resolving technical issues
 
Sometimes, you may encounter technical issues when playing Europa Universalis 4 multiplayer. Here are some common problems and solutions. One problem is that you have different DLCs than the host or other players. The solution is to disable any DLCs that are not shared by everyone in the game[^3^]. Another problem is that you have different versions of the game than the host or other players. The solution is to check the checksum of your game, which is a four-letter code that appears next to your version number in the main menu. If your checksum does not match with others, you need to update or reinstall your game[^1^]. A third problem is that you have firewall or network issues that prevent you from connecting or hosting a game. The solution is to check your firewall settings and allow network traffic to reach your computer[^1^]. Paradox does not offer any support for troubleshooting connection issues, so you may need to consult online forums or guides for more help.
 
## Playing a multiplayer game
 
Once you are in a multiplayer game, there are some differences from playing solo. One difference is that pausing and speed are controlled by the host, not by individual players. The space bar is disabled as a pause button in multiplayer, since it is used frequently while typing in chat[^1^]. Another difference is that options such as autosave, ironman mode, and achievements are also determined by the host[^1^]. A third difference is that intelligence about other countries is more limited and unreliable in multiplayer, since
