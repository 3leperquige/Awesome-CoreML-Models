## Need For Speed Rivals Tips and Tricks
 
If you want to get the most out of Need For Speed Rivals, here are some tips and tricks that might help you.

- As a racer, you need to avoid getting busted by the cops. You can use your weapons and gadgets, such as turbo, shockwave, jammer, and EMP, to slow down or disable the cops. You can also use shortcuts, jumps, and hideouts to escape from them.
- As a cop, you need to bust as many racers as possible. You can use your weapons and gadgets, such as spike strips, roadblocks, helicopter support, and EMP, to stop or damage the racers. You can also use teamwork and communication with other cops to coordinate your attacks.
- As both racer and cop, you need to manage your speed points (SP), which are the currency of the game. You earn SP by completing events and challenges, busting or escaping from cops, and performing stunts and near misses. You can use SP to buy new cars, upgrades, weapons, and gadgets. However, you also risk losing SP if you get busted or wrecked. You can bank your SP by returning to your hideout or command post.
- As both racer and cop, you need to be aware of your surroundings. You can use the mini-map and the head-up display (HUD) to see the location of other players, events, challenges, hideouts, command posts, gas stations, repair shops, and more. You can also use the EasyDrive menu to access various options and features without pausing the game.
