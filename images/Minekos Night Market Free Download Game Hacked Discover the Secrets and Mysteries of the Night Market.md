## What is Mineko's Night Market?
  
Mineko's Night Market is a game that celebrates Japanese culture while introducing a heartwarming story about friendship, tradition, and many, many cats. You play as Mineko, a curious girl who has just arrived at her new home on a struggling Japanese-inspired island at the base of Mount Fugu. The superstitious locals on the island worship the Sun Cat, Nikko. What was always thought to be a long-told myth has the town puzzled, as sightings of Nikko have begun to surface among the residents of the island in recent days.
  
Your goal is to discover the secrets behind the town and restore the struggling village to its former glory. All the while, you have to manage your daily activities, complete various jobs, venture on whimsical quests, and craft peculiar items in preparation for the weekly Night Market. The Night Market is where you can befriend and barter with dozens of townsfolk, play and compete in a variety of games like themed parades, cat racing, and stage performances, and enjoy all the cats you can imagine.
  
The game features hours of exploration and four seasons to experience across the vast island of Mt. Fugu. The game also boasts a charming art style, a catchy soundtrack, and a quirky humor that will make you smile. The game is developed by Meowza Games and published by Humble Games. It is expected to be released in 2023 for Nintendo Switch[^3^], Steam[^2^], and other platforms.
