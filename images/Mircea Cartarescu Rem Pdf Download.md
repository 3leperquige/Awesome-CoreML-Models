Mircea Cartarescu - REM is not only a novel, but also a metafictional experiment that challenges the boundaries between literature and reality. The narrator often addresses the reader directly, commenting on his own writing process and the nature of fiction. He also plays with various genres and styles, such as realism, fantasy, science fiction, poetry, and essay. He creates a rich and diverse literary universe that reflects his own personal and cultural influences.
 
One of the main themes of the novel is the relationship between dreams and memories, and how they shape our identity and perception of reality. The narrator claims that he has a special gift of remembering all his dreams since he was a child, and that he can enter a state of lucid dreaming at will. He believes that his dreams are more real than his waking life, and that they reveal the hidden truths of his existence. He also explores the connections between his dreams and his memories, and how they influence each other. He tries to reconstruct his past from the fragments of his recollections, but he also acknowledges the unreliability and subjectivity of memory.
 
Another theme of the novel is the role of art and literature in human life, and how they can transcend the limitations of time and space. The narrator is an avid reader and writer, who draws inspiration from various sources, such as Romanian folklore, classical mythology, modern philosophy, surrealism, and postmodernism. He also meets and interacts with several famous writers and artists, such as Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortazar, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Salvador Dali, and Andy Warhol. He considers art and literature as forms of magic that can create alternative realities and open new possibilities for human existence.
