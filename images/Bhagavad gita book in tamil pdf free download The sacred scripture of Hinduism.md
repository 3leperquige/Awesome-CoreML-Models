The Bhagavad Gita was first translated into Tamil by Injikollai Sivarama Sastry in 1908. He was a scholar and a devotee of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who founded the Ramakrishna Mission. Sivarama Sastry's translation was based on the commentary of Shankara, one of the most influential philosophers of Advaita Vedanta. Sivarama Sastry's translation was published by Ramakrishna Math Chennai and it is still widely used by Tamil readers.
  
Another popular translation of the Bhagavad Gita in Tamil is by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who was the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Prabhupada's translation was based on his own commentary called Bhagavad-gita As It Is, which presents Krishna as the supreme personality of Godhead and emphasizes bhakti or devotion as the highest path. Prabhupada's translation was published by The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (BBT) and it has been distributed to millions of people around the world.
