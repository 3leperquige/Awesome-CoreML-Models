## The Beginnings of a Mythical Girl

However, her big break came in 1997, when she was chosen by Kishin Shinoyama to be the subject of his photobook *Shinwa-Shoujo*. The photobook featured Chiaki in various settings and costumes, ranging from innocent to provocative. Some of the photos also showed her partially nude, which caused controversy and criticism from some sectors of society. The photobook became a best-seller, but was discontinued by the publisher in 1999 after the institution of new anti-child pornography laws.
 
Despite the controversy, Chiaki gained recognition and admiration for her beauty and charisma. She was dubbed as the "mythical girl" by the media and fans, and became a symbol of youth and innocence. She also received offers to act in movies, which led to her debut in the 1997 film *Gonin*.
 
## The Rise of a Movie Star
 
Chiaki's movie career took off in 2000, when she starred in two influential films that showcased her talent and versatility. The first one was *Shikoku*, a horror film where she played a girl who returns to her hometown and discovers a dark secret involving her childhood friend. The second one was *Battle Royale*, a dystopian thriller where she played Takako Chigusa, a fierce student who fights for survival in a deadly game.
 
*Battle Royale* was a huge hit in Japan and abroad, and became a cult classic among fans of violent and provocative cinema. Chiaki's performance as Takako was praised for its intensity and realism, and she won several awards for her role. She also gained international attention and recognition, especially from director Quentin Tarantino, who was impressed by her acting skills and charisma.
 
In 2003, Tarantino cast Chiaki as Gogo Yubari, the schoolgirl bodyguard of yakuza boss O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), in his film *Kill Bill: Volume 1*. Chiaki's role was one of the most memorable scenes in the film, as she fought against Uma Thurman's character with a meteor hammer. Chiaki's portrayal of Gogo was both cute and deadly, and she became an instant icon of pop culture.
 
*Kill Bill: Volume 1* was a huge success worldwide, and catapulted Chiaki to Hollywood stardom. She received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike, and was nominated for several awards. She also became one of the most recognizable Japanese actresses in the West, and opened up more opportunities for her to work with other international filmmakers.
 
## The Continuation of a Legendary Career
 
After *Kill Bill: Volume 1*, Chiaki continued to work on various projects in Japan and abroad. She starred in films such as *Azumi 2: Death or Love*, *The Great Yokai War*, *Exte: Hair Extensions*, *Kamikaze Girls*, *The Sky Crawlers*, *Ekusu Makina*, *Goth: Love of Death*
